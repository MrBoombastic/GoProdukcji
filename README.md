## Simple Discord bot integrated with Ghost CMS

### Using now-released library Bfcord!

# Functions:

- automatically crosspost all messages on Discord's news channels
- automatically send links to new blog posts on Discord (and Twitter in the future!)
- basic commands (`help` and `stats`)
- `search` command, which searches for posts on Ghost

Note: This app is being developed with my very little knowledge about Go. But it helps me to learn that language. ðŸ˜‰
